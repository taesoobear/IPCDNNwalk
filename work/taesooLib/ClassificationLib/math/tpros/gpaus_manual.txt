This file assumes familiarity with Gaussian Process modelling.

The file gpaus.ps in this directory is the paper "Gaussian Process
Modelling of Austenite Formation in Steel" by Bailer-Jones, Bhadeshia
& MacKay, 1998 (hereafter BJBM98). This explains the austenite
modelling problem, the dataset, the basics of Gaussian Process
modelling, as well as the results of our work. I strongly recommend
you read this paper before proceeding.

#                    Introduction to the Problem                     #
######################################################################

The problem we are interested in is that of predicting the
temperatures at which Austenite starts to form (Ac1) and that at which
Austenite formation is complete (Ac3) during the continuous heating of
a steel alloy. This prediction is made as a function of the heating
rate and the the element compositions. The modelling procedure is the
standard empirical one, i.e. the model is trained on a set of
empirical data for which the "outputs" are known. As a GP
can only have one "output" we use two separate GPs to model
the Ac1 and Ac3 problems.

######################################################################

This work was done while Tpros was still under development, and later
Tpros versions were not always backwardly compatible with earlier
versions. The data for the 12d problem used Tpros version 5.1 (or
maybe slightly earlier).  The data for the 22d problem used Tpros
version 6.1.  In particular the nature of the output files, and the
way of expressing the prior, is different in these two versions.

As explained in BJBM98, I suggest you use the 12d data and model to
make predictions of the Ac1 and Ac3 temperatures. The 22d is only
provided for completness. As you are likely to use a later version of
Tpros than the one I used, you may have to make alterations to the
specfile, and the output files may be slightly different.  See the
TManual with your distribution of Tpros.

#                              The Data                              #
######################################################################

The results presented in BJBM98 are for a 12-dimensional input space.
These are the heating rate (HR) and 11 alloying elements.  This is
called the "12d" dataset and resides in the directory 12d/

The order in which the 12 variables appear
as columns in the data files is:
1.  C
2.  Si
3.  Mn
4.  Cu
5.  Ni
6.  Cr
7.  Mo
8.  Nb
9.  V
10. W
11. Co
12. HR (heating rate)

The elements are in units of wt-% (i.e. mass fraction as a percentage)
for the elements and K/s for HR.

The data set consists of 788 lines (input-output pairs). Each input
and output variable has been linearly scaled to lie in the range
-0.5 to +0.5 (see BJBM98 for details). This has then been randomly split
into two subsets of 394 lines each: the training (tr) and testing (ts)
sets. The relevant files in the 12d/ directory will now be described.

12d/aus.tr.in.dat     12 columns, 394 lines.
		      The input training data.
12d/aus.tr.in.dat     12 columns, 394 lines.
		      The input test data.
(The columns for these files are the 12 inputs listed above)

12d/aus.tr.ac1.dat    1 column, 394 lines.
		      The Ac1 training data target (output) values.
12d/aus.ts.ac1.dat    1 column, 394 lines.
		      The Ac1 test data output values.
12d/aus.tr.ac3.dat    1 column, 394 lines.
		      The Ac3 training data target (output) values.
12d/aus.ts.ac3.dat    1 column, 394 lines.
		      The Ac3 test data output values.

These files are fed into the GP model and used to train and test it.
The model produces a number of output files:

aus.ac1.hyp4	     The GP hyperparameters from the Ac1 problem.
aus.ac3.hyp4	     The GP hyperparameters from the Ac3 problem.

These should be self-explanatory, but note that the
log(noise variance) term is log base e. As Tpros trains, it will dump
the hyperparameters to a file myhyp.dump, where myhyp is the "hypout"
file you specify in the specfile. The two in the 12d/ directory are:

aus.ac1.hyp4.dump
aus.ac3.hyp4.dump

These have 17 columns each, corresponding to the 17 hyperparameters:
    1	   Line number
2--13	   The 12 length scales (1 for each input)
   14	   Theta_1 (scale of exponential term in covariance function)
   15	   Theta_2 (constant offset in covariance function)
   16	   log(noise variance)
   17	   Theta_0 (mean of GP)

The next four filles are produced by applying the trained GP model.

aus.tr.ac1.NN.dat    3 columns, 394 lines
		     The Ac1 outputs predicted by the GP for the
		     training data.
aus.ts.ac1.NN.dat    3 columns, 394 lines
		     The Ac1 outputs predicted by the GP for the
		     test data.
aus.tr.ac3.NN.dat    3 columns, 394 lines
		     The Ac3 outputs predicted by the GP for the
		     training data.
aus.ts.ac3.NN.dat    3 columns, 394 lines
		     The Ac3 outputs predicted by the GP for the
		     test data.

The three columns in each of these files are:
1. true output, t
2. GP predicted output, y
3. GP predicted error on output, Ne (see below)

e is the 1 sigma error (standard deviation) in this prediction,
so the result we report is y +/- e.
N is the no. of standard devations we chose to report in the specfile
(set by INT_No._of_s.d.)_error_bars). Thus if N=1 (which it usual)
then y+e is the upper limit of the error bar and y-e is the lower limit.

NB When we have no target values for the data files, i.e. the entry
   INT_target_file
   is absent from the specfile, the first column will be absent. This
   is the case when we apply Tpros to new alloys (see below).

Note that these files in the 12d/ directory were produced using an
older version of Tpros (probably version 5.1, or maybe a slightly
earlier one).
In the newer version (6.1), there are six columns in these output files:
1. predicted value, y
2. error, Ne
3. lower error value, y-Ne
4. upper error value, y+Ne
5. Noise level (this will be the same for all values if we are using
   a simple constant noise model, i.e. if we have set
   No._of_basis_functions_used_for_noise_model  to 1 in the specfile)
6. true output, t (if INT_target_file was not specified in the
   specfile this will be blank, i.e. we only have five columns)
Version 6.1 was used to produce the 22d results (described later).

The other files in the 12d/ directory are used to predict Ac1 and Ac3
for a variety of alloys (i.e. specific input combinations), as
described in BJBM98. For each alloy there are three files, which
for carbon (car, C) are:

input file					aus.Pcar.in.dat
Ac1 predicted outputs (as produced by Tpros)	aus.Pcar.ac1.NN.dat
Ac3 predicted outputs (as produced by Tpros)	aus.Pcar.ac3.NN.dat

The columns in these files were explained above, but of course in the
output (NN) files, there is no column for the target values because no
target file was specified in the specfile.  The other elements use
their proper chemical symbol.  "hr" stands for "heating rate".
In each input file, all inputs except one (the one which the file
is named after) are the same on every line. Thus in a given
file we are varying the alloying fraction of just one element.
The other elements are held constant at zero (except for Carbon: see 
BJBM98 for details.)


The directory 22d/ contains the files for the 22d problem in BJBM98.
(This used to be called newgp/ i.e. the directory with the complete
contents is ~/w/metal_data/austenite/newgp/ .) These file names follow
the same convention as used in the 12d problem. These files for the
22d problem were generated with version 6.1 of Tpros, so the columns
for the output (NN) files are slightly different, as explained above.
All of the files in 12d/ have their counterparts here, except that for
the 22d problem the results of interpolating the training data are not
here, i.e. the files aus.tr.ac1.NN.dat and aus.tr.ac3.NN.dat are
missing in 22d/ Also, the application files for the additional 10
elements of the 22d dataset are not here (aus.Pti.ac1.NN.dat etc.).

Note also that the method for specifying the priors differs between
versions 5.1 and 6.1. In the latter (used for the 22d data) I could
specify the a and b parameters for the prior probability distributions
directly (although the specfile parameter "noise_prior_cbjb" is the
reciprocal of the b parameter in the equations below: see section
"Notes for myself below".) Confused? Well, I don't suggest you use the
22d model at all. I'm just giving you the data for completness.

######################################################################

The Tpros program is not included with this distribution, as I do not
maintain it. Therefore I cannot be responsible for any failures of
backward compatibility of later versions of Tpros!  Tpros is
maintained by David MacKay and can be downloaded from the following
web site:

http://wol.ra.phy.cam.ac.uk/mng10/GP/GP.html

Tpros is an ANSI C program for UNIX/Linux machines. 
It takes a single command line input, i.e.

Tpros specfile

where specfile is the name of the specfile containing all the
file and model details.

The file Tspec_aus.12d is the Tpros specfile for running on the 12d
dataset, and was used to create the output files in the 12d/
directory.  Full details of the specfile can be found in the file
Tpros manual, TManual, which is included here.

We use a single Gaussian in the covariace function, and assume
constant noise inputs. I have not experimented systematically with
varying the initial values of the hyperparameters.  The Gibbs
"length_scale_compression" hyperparameter is shrouded in some mystery
so I have left it set at its default value.

I have attempted in the past to use the linear term in the covariance
function, but have had nothing but bad experiences with
it. Essentially it does not do what it was intended to do (introduce a
linear trend into the predictions), possibly because the linear term
hyperparameters are not independent of the exponential term ones. Or
maybe it hasn't been coded correctly. But whatever the problem, it
doesn't work, and sometimes the solution it gives is crazy.  I suggest
you avoid the linear term.

Tpros uses David MacKay's conjugate gradient optimizer "macopt".  I
have generally found that 400 iterations are sufficient to achieve
convergence on the austenite problem at a convergence tolerance of
0.001. Setting this tolerance is not really possible a priori in my
experience: it's best just to set it low with a large number of
iterations, train the model and then see what the evidence and
gradient do as a function of iteration number. A bit of
experimentation can then be used to set the correct tolerance. The
austenite problem (or rather this data set and model combination)
seems to be a well-behaved one in terms of the evidence surface, so
setting the tolerance in this way is reasonably reliable (albeit
somewhat roundabout). Note that Tpros will dump the hyperparameters to
a file as it trains, so you can check that training was not stopped
prematurely by ensuring that the hyperparameters have levelled out by
the time training ceases.

I have used LU decomposition (specified under option
"OPT_Inversion_Method_(CG/LU)") for the matrix inversion in the
optimization stage. The speed of this is order N^3, where N is the
number of lines in the training data set (because the matrix to be
inverted is size N*N). For large N this will be slow, so the conjugate
gradient (CG) method (an approximate inversion method) can be used.
The speed of the CG method is supposedly of order N^2. However, I have
found that in practice CG is no faster than LU. Gibbs shows tests in
his thesis in which CG is faster than LU for large N, but I have not
found this on the austenite problem. This could be because I have 12
input dimensions, whereas I think the tests were done for 1 or 2 input
dimensions. Furthermore the speeds of the two methods may have a
different dependence on the number of input dimensions.  But whatever
it is, Tpros becomes prohibitively slow on the austenite problem for
N>1000 for either LU or CG. I think the training time on wol (a Sparc
5) was more than 24 hours for the full austenite data set (N=12, 788
lines).

There is no need to use both the theta_0 and theta_2 hyperparameter
terms, as in Tpros they do the equivalent job. Therefore it's probably
best to initialise one at zero and not to optimize it. If you do use
both initialised at zero, Tpros seems to leave one at zero.

In the application (interpolation) stage, I have been using the direct
LU method (LUi), on the recommendation of Gibbs.

#			The Hyperparameter Priors                    #
######################################################################

The present version of Tpros seems to crash if you do not specify priors
on your hyperparameters.


Noise Prior
-----------

The noise prior is specified using an inverse gamma function:

P(x) = C*x^(a+1) exp(b/x)

so that

ln P(x) = lnC - (a+1)*ln(x) - b/x

Tpros requires that you specify the parameters (a,b) of this
distribution using the mean and degrees of freedom (dof). Their
relationship to a and b is:

a = dof/2
b = dof*mean/2 = a*mean

dof  = 2a
mean = b/a


Length Scale Prior
------------------

The priors on the length scales are expressed using the gamma function

P(x) = C*b^a x^(a-1) exp(-bx)

so that

ln P(x) = lnC + a*ln(b) + (a-1)*ln(x) - b*x

Again, a and b must be specified via the mean and degrees of freedom
(dof):

a = dof
b = dof/mean

mean = a/b
dof  = a = (mean/sd)^2


Theta_0 uses a Gaussian prior with a mean and variance representation.
Theta_1 uses an inverse gamma prior with the mean and dof representation.
Theta_2 uses an inverse gamma prior with the mean and dof representation.

I left the Theta hyperparameter priors at their default settings
(i.e. used "d" as the input) and tried not to worry about it too
much. However, these default priors are ignorant of your data;
specfically they are scale independent. Thus if your data are not
scaled to lie in the approximate range -0.5 to +0.5, then the default
priors are unlikely to be suitable.

#                           Notes to myself                          #
######################################################################

Your deduction of the form for the inverse gamma function used for the
noise prior is from line 2369 of Tpros.c where I assume that w[tint+1]
is the x value and C is a normalization constant.


The constant b used in Tpros (e.g. gamn_b, gamr_b) is the reciprocal
of the b you use in your notebook. I think this applies to both the
gamma and inverse gamma functions.

When we could have mean/sd priors we had:

length_prior_mean				1.5
length_prior_sd					1.22

and

noise_prior_cbja                                0.1
noise_prior_cbjb                                200.0

these translate to:

and

noise_prior_mean                                0.05
noise_prior_dof                                 0.2
